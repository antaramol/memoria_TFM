	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are predicted to infiltrate most industries within the next decade, creating a personal, industrial, and social shift towards the new technology. As a result, there has been a surge of interest and research towards user acceptance of AI technology in recent years. However, the existing research appears dispersed and lacks systematic synthesis, limiting our understanding of user acceptance of AI technologies. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis guidelines using five databases: EBSCO host, Embase, Inspec (Engineering Village host), Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers were required to focus on both user acceptance and AI technology. Acceptance was defined as the behavioural intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service. A total of 7912 articles were identified in the database search. Sixty articles were included in the review. Most studies (n = 31) did not define AI in their papers, and 38 studies did not define AI for their participants. The extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the most frequently used theory to assess user acceptance of AI technologies. Perceived usefulness, performance expectancy, attitudes, trust, and effort expectancy significantly and positively predicted behavioural intention, willingness, and use behaviour of AI across multiple industries. However, in some cultural scenarios, it appears that the need for human contact cannot be replicated or replaced by AI, no matter the perceived usefulness or perceived ease of use. Given that most of the methodological approaches present in the literature have relied on self-reported data, further research using naturalistic methods is needed to validate the theoretical model/s that best predict the adoption of AI technologies.}

abstract = {In the current work, a conducted subjective evaluation of three basic components of a framework for applied Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) for theatrical performance and social media communication and interaction is presented. The multidisciplinary survey group used for the evaluation is consisted of participants with Theatrical and Performance Arts background, as well as Journalism and Mass Communications Studies. Initially, a publically available database of emotional speech utterances, Acted Emotional Speech Dynamic Database (AESDD) is evaluated. We examine the degree of agreement between the perceived emotion by the participants and the intended expressed emotion in the AESDD recordings. Furthermore, the participants are asked to choose between different coloured lighting of certain scenes captured on video. Correlations between the emotional content of the scenes and selected colors are observed and discussed. Finally, a prototype application for SER and multimodal speech emotion data gathering is evaluated in terms of Usefulness, Ease of Use, Ease of Learning and Satisfaction.},
